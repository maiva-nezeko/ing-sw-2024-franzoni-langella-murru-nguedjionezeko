# Software engineering project
The final project of Software Engineering, course of Computer Science Engineering held at Politecnico di Milano during the academic year 2023/2024, presents the implementation of a distributed system which plays a vital role in the organization of the game.
The following game gives the possibility to the client (player) to play one single session, while the server is able to manage multiple matches/game.

## Implemented features
| Feature               | Status |
|-----------------------|--------|
| UML(high level)       |   ✅   |
| Model(complete rules) |   ✅   |
| Networking            |   ✅   |
| Controller            |   ✅   |
| TUI                   |   ✅   |
| GUI                   |   ✅   |
| Persistence           |   ✅   |
| Multiple Games        |   ✅   |
| Connection resilience |   ✅   |


## Testing
Almost all model and controller classes have a class and method coverage of 100% (except for trivial methods like getters and setters).

## Requirements
In order to successfully execute the .jar applications, which can be found here, both Windows and Java 21 are required.
If you wish to compile the project independently, it is necessary to download the GitHub repository:
Afterwards, it can be compiled using your IDE of choice, provided with the required dependencies, java-21-openjdk and javafx-sdk-21.0.1.
